# Node.js & Express.js Contact Form Server

## üß† What I Learned
In this project, I explored the fundamentals of **Node.js** and **Express.js** by building a simple backend server to handle a contact form. Specifically, I learned:

- How **Node.js** functions as a backend JavaScript runtime environment.
- How to use **Express.js** to create a basic HTTP server.
- How to serve static files (HTML, CSS) from a `/public` directory.
- How to handle form submissions and process POST requests.
- How to use the **body-parser** middleware to parse incoming form data.
- How to log submitted form data on the server.
- How to redirect users to a thank-you page after form submission.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the Server Works

- The server is built using **Express.js** and listens on **port 3000**.
- Static files such as HTML and CSS are served from the `/public` folder using:
  
  ```js
  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "public")));
````

* When a user submits the contact form:

  * The form data (name, email, and message) is sent as a **POST** request to the `/submit` endpoint.

  * Express handles this request with:

    ```js
    app.post("/submit", (req, res) => { 
      // handle form data
    });
    ```

  * The submitted data is logged to the server console and stored temporarily in an in-memory array.

  * The user is then redirected to a thank-you page (`/thankyou.html`).

## ‚ùó Challenges Faced

* **Dependency installation issues** due to npm cache errors such as:

  ```
  Tracker "idealTree" already exists
  ```

  I resolved this by clearing the npm cache and deleting `package-lock.json` and `node_modules` before reinstalling.

* Navigating between different drives in the terminal (e.g., switching from `Z:\` to `C:\`).

* Deploying the app online was initially new to me, but platforms like **Glitch** and **Render** made it much easier.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Project Locally

1. Clone the repository.

2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

3. Start the server with:

   ```
   node app.js
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

5. Fill out and submit the contact form.

6. You should be redirected to the thank-you page after submission.
